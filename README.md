# TeamProfiles
This script helps a manager to build his new team. To start this program, a user uses node index.js. It asks a set of questions. I enter data about my employees.

Then HTML file is generated. It displays nicely formatted team roster based on user input. When I click on email address in the HTML my default email program opens.

When I click on github user name Githun profile opens in a new tab.

When I start the application, I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number. When I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number, I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern. Current version has only two team members, but future version will have option to add another member or to finish building my team. You saw that screenshot above. When I select the engineer option, I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu. When I select the intern option
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school. 
# Future Work
As I mentioned, this version is not perfect or final. I will add a couple of other features later. I will add an option to add more team members. Also, test using Jest is not working yet. I created __test__ folder with relevant files. This jest package is less relevant for me as a manufacturing engineer. It will wait.

Will ask a tutor to help later. I was a nice experience. I feel I am getting better in creating functions and debugging problems. Thank you for reading.
